# Hikki 
## Minimalistic Note-taking Tool

*Hikki* is a simple local wiki based on [Markdown][md].

![Hikki](http://pcapriotti.github.com/hikki/pics/thumbs/hikki1.png)

Notes are written and edited using an embedded [Kate][] editor, and displayed on an embedded [Webkit][] browser. You can switch between editing mode and display mode seamlessly using the toolbar or by using the shortcuts *Alt+1* and *Alt+2*.

There's no save button in Hikki. Everything is saved automatically and rendered immediately.

The syntax is standard markdown, with an extension for [[interlinks]]: write something inside \[\[double brackets\]\] to create a link to another note. Clicking on the link will bring you to a newly created (empty) note, that you can then edit.
